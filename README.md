## Introduction

This app intends to create a quicker and more optimal food delivery system.

---

### Prologue 

- Food delivery has become increasingly prevalent, emphasizing the need for a cost-efficient, friendly, and swift service.
- Implementing tiered systems with an 'Always Free' delivery option aims to promote community support for both users and the app.
- Emphasis on ease-of-use and rewards aims to elevate the app's standing in the saturated competitive market.

---

### **Discussion**

- When developing an app like this, we need to consider the technical aspects of permissions for both user and restaurant data, this includes GPS, payment information, and further details
- In the competitive landscape, the app must offer a compelling rate and mission to attract and benefit its stakeholders.
- Optimization, including automation for restaurants, is crucial for establishing a seamless and efficient food delivery experience.
- Integration with various payment gateways is necessary for secure and seamless transactions.

### **Solution**

- Restrictions
- Automation
- Pattern Recognition and Rewards
- Integrated Community Details
- Further analysis of local payment systems.

### **Consequences *

The hope is that these decisions will address increasing complaints from both users and restaurants about the dominant apps in the market.

## Specifics

---

In the context of users being inundated with rising costs, we decided to tier delivery windows. Free delivery would promote community, accepting that there is a need to open the delivery window for additional cost.

In the context of restaurants adapting to new systems, we propose integrating with their current inventory system for an overall better experience. This acknowledges the additional time commitment required from our teams.

In the context of users often ordering similar foods, we propose offering a quick-buy and rewards program, keeping users engaged. The rewards would be part of a partnership program with participating restaurants only.

In the context of user reviews, we propose offering more in-depth forums to promote better discussion about the quality and experience of a restaurant.

### Discussion

As the market for food delivery apps has become more and more congested, there is a need for innovation that
supports the users and restaurants. Assuming the delivery drivers themselves are being compensated fairly 
and, in accordance with local laws, the next order of business would be keeping the economy of the app thriving.
In order to do so, innovations like free options, community support, and reward programs can be implemented.
Saying that, however, is easier than delivering. There are partnership programs that need to be established.
Restaurants have to agree to the concepts we are providing. Users need to feel comfortable permitting the app
to track sensitive information, like location and payment methods, as well as agreeing to scour for pattern
recognition data to help optimize each individual's experience. If users and restaurants buy into the general
concept, then drivers will flock to the system that keeps them paid appropriately and busy.

### Solution

- Provide a concise list of restaurants within a close proximity, roughly fifteen minutes from a user's location. This should provide a range of choices, without over-inundating the user. 
	- Limited options but there could be an additional charge if the user wanted to explore outside of their close community.
	- App can have a better GPS ping system to provide more accurate details on delivery times.
- Integrate the app with restaurants' inventory management systems to ensure accurate and up-to-date menus.
	- Evaluate synchronization methods, such as APIs or web scraping, for efficient data updates.
- Implement a user review and rating feature for informed decisions.
	- Design and implement a system for collecting, displaying, and moderating user-generated content.
	- Dedicate a small team to moderate the review system.
- Provide users access to their order history and incentivize reordering through rewards.
	- Establish efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms for order history.
	- Develop incentive partnership programs for participating restaurants.
- Evaluate different payment gateway options, considering security, user experience, supported regions, and transaction fees.

### Consequences

As this is a preliminary examination of problem areas and potential innovations within the current food delivery app climate, no consequences can be accurately tracked at this stage.
